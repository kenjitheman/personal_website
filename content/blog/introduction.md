Hi there. This is the introduction to my blog. Here I'll be sharing my thoughts, ideas, and experiences.

This is a first post, so I'll keep it short. I hope u enjoy reading it on this beautiful website with a nice pure dark theme, without any ads or tracking, without fucking javascript fucusing on nice UX && performance and with a nice typography.

And also, of course, my blog is open source. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/kenjitheman/personal_website)

I'm looking forward to sharing more with you soon. Stay tuned!
